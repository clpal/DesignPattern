# Architectural Patterns VS Design Patterns
# Architecture
1:Architecture is the overall structure of software.<br />
2: Architecture is the structure of the software system in its entirety.<br/>
3: Developer chooses different design pattern according to the architecture specification and requirement.<br />
4: It’s define the granularity of the component.<br />

# Design pattern:
1. Design patterns are concerned with how the components are built.
2. It’s about particular solution.<br/>
<span style="color:blue">**1.Creational design patterns**</span><br/>

<span style="color:blue"> **Abstract factory pattern:**</span><br/>
 provide an interface to create objects without specifying the classes.<br/>
<span style="color:blue"> **Singleton pattern:**</span><br/>
provide only a single instance of the calls and global access to this instance.<br/>
<span style="color:blue"> **Builder Pattern:**</span>
Separate the construction from representation and allows the same construction to create multiple representations.<br/>
<span style="color:blue"> **Prototype pattern::**</span>
creating duplicate without affecting the performance and memory. So the duplicate object is built from the skeleton of an existing object.<br/>
<span style="color:blue">**2. Structural patterns:**</span><br/>

<span style="color:blue"> **Adapter pattern:**</span><br/>
 <span style="color:blue"> **Bridge pattern:**</span><br/>
 <span style="color:blue"> **Composite pattern:**</span><br/>
 <span style="color:blue"> **Decorator pattern:**</span><br/>
  <span style="color:blue"> **Decorator pattern:**</span><br/>
 <span style="color:blue"> **Flyweight pattern**</span><br/>
 <span style="color:blue"> **Proxy pattern:**</span><br/>
 
 <span style="color:blue">**3. Behavioral patterns:**</span><br/>
 
  <span style="color:blue"> **Responsibility pattern:**</span><br/>
   <span style="color:blue"> **Command pattern:**</span><br/>
    <span style="color:blue"> **Iterator pattern:**</span><br/>
    
# Differences :
1.Architecture comes in Designing phase and Design Patterns comes in Building phase.<br/>
2.Architectural pattern is like a blue print and design pattern is actual implementation.<br/>
3.Architecture is base which everything else adhere to and design pattern is a way to structure classes to solve common problems.<br />

4. All Architecture is design pattern but all design pattern can not be architecture. Like MVC can come under both. But singleton design pattern can not be an architecture pattern. MVC, MVVM all come under both.<br />
5. Architecture : how components should behave and communicate in the system, set the physical location of components and finally choose the tools in order to create components. Design : while architecture deals more with the wide picture, design should drill down into the details relating to implementing certain components. Designing of components end up with classes, interfaces, abstract classes and other OO feature in order to fulfil the given component tasks.<br />

6.Architectural Patterns are similar to Design Patterns, but they have a different scope. In a few words, while Design Patterns impact a specific section of the code base, Architectural Patterns are high-level strategies that concern large-scale components, the global properties and mechanisms of a system
